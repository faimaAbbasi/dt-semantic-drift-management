NCI_C49328, on the other hand, is more general and accurately captures the concept of a layer in the retina, which is consistent with the source class. Therefore, I chose NCI_C49328 as the best match."

Additionally, both classes are instances of 'thing' and 'brain part', indicating they have similar characteristics. While the other candidates may have higher scores in terms of numerical similarity, this match is more semantically fitting considering the contextual information."

Furthermore, both classes are related to brain nuclei, and the context of 'intralaminar nucleus' in the target class matches well with the source class's label 'interpeduncular nucleus'. This alignment is equivalent because it captures the same concept from different species."

The target class URI and context indicate a broader category of skin that includes extremities like arms and legs, which aligns with the source class's description as a subclass of limb skin.
